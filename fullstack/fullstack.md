# Summary of Full Stack for Front-End Engineers, v2
Summary of Full Stack for Front-End Engineers, v2 by Jem Young. The goal of this class to learn to move back and forth between UI and the back-end through the command line, SSH, nginx, docker containers, server security, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 and more.

# Introduction
### What is Fullstack
Someone who can build an application from start to finish, including front end and backend.

### Why Fullstack

A full-stack developer is a person who can handle both sides of a development project, which are the front end and the back end. As a full-stack developer, you'd be able to handle servers, databases, as well as clients. There are different kinds of stacks, and it depends on the project's requirements as to which one you'd use.

### Command Line
Every operating system have command line, whether its windows, mac or linux. Its consistent, the command line always gonna be the same. 
- Fast
- Consistent
- Easier to automate

Command line are important because not all server have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and theres no limitation, no matter how well designed the GUI you cannot encompass all the possibilities. Some example of more familiar command line :
- `cd` - change directory
- `ls` - list directory content
- `pwd` - print working directory
- `mkdir` - make directory
- `rmdir` - remove directory
- `cat` - show file contents
- `man` - command manual
- `less` - show file contents by page
- `rm` - remove file
- `echo` - repeat input
- 

### Shells


The shell is the outermost layer of the operating system. Shells incorporate a programming language to control processes and files, as well as to start and control other programs. The shell manages the interaction between you and the operating system by prompting you for input, interpreting that input for the operating system, and then handling any resulting output from the operating system.
The shells is just a frontline that is the user interface of some sorts, and it just talk to the application or the OS which talk to the kernel, and the kernel is the core of operating system.



# Servers
It serves content and also respond request, it serves something back.
### VIM
Vim is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix. It is an improved clone of Bill Joy's vi. Some more vim [command cheat sheets](https://linuxmoz.com/vi-commands-cheat-sheet/)

### Data centers and the cloud
Servers generally live in place called data center, a place full or racks of machine in a really cold environments. So a data center is just this colletions of computers, often shared between application and/or different companies.
